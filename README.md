# Dataverse-Datathon
Data visualization on covid data and covid vaccination

Inspiration
With so much information being collected through data analysis in the business world today, we must have a way to paint a picture of that data so we can interpret it. Data visualization gives us a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. This makes the data more natural for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within large data sets. One of the best examples of effective and interactive dashboards could be the recent COVID-19 dashboards. It is the basis of how we are seeing and measuring the impact of this virus in the world. Various countries and even states or regions have created their own COVID-19 dashboards to make people aware of the pandemic and asking them to take preventive measures. This is a great example of using data to educate the masses based on finding insights and educate them through visuals.

What it does
phase1

Add upto 5 Countries for Comparison
Comparison via Recovered/Confirmed/Deceased cases
Cards to display overall stats of Countries selected.
Prefetch List of Countries
phase2

1.Data visualization on the vaccination provided by different countries 2.What is the number of total vaccinations & daily vaccinations according to countries? 3.Which vaccine is used by which Country? 4.Country Wise Daily Vaccination 5.Which Vaccine is Used the most?

How we built it
I build this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript , Geomap and plotify to provide a graphical representation of he given set of data. I also used notebook to analysis and provide key insights about the vaccination

Challenges we ran into
There was a lot of challenges I ran into : building the project from scratch working solo finding the right data filtering out the dataset

Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of creating 2 unique data visualizations that are easy to read and interactive under the time constraints given. I have never made project on Data visualization, so learning the technology provided some challenges, especially when attempting to make any styling changes. I am also proud at providing Key Observations at the end of the vaccination analysis.

The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics . In every Hackathon, proper time management ⏰plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress; I understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct ✨and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback.

What we learned
I got a learn a lot from the webinar hosted. These video helped me develop these project, gave me ideas on how to build it, Helped me link the Geo Map too :)

What's next for Data Viz COVID
Try developing more data visualization for more and more diseases and make use of data. And provide more insights and analysis on these data use more different dataset and provide more analysis on the data.
